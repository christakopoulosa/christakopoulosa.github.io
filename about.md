My name is Argyrios Christakopoulos. I graduated from the University of Nottingham's <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/economics/"economic school</> with an MSc in
Economics and Financial economics. Currently I am part of the digital Graduate scheme in the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) undertaking my last rotation in user research
at the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/traffic-commissioners">Office of the Traffic Commissioner</> in Leeds.
