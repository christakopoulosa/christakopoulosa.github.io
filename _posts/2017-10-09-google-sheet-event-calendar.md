This past week I started experimenting with Google Apps Script. A lot of govermnet events are going on usually advertised via
the goverment slack. I wanted a way to organise all thse events that are randomly popping in my slack and share the calendar. 
Usually I do forget to register for event sof my interest.

Let's ee how to set up event reminders using Google Apps Script then. 

Firstly I pull some data from the Gov Slack manually. You can access the google sheet <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1drDsKHDkim-5XzufJMd8iIvSj8uuPOdARj0GzF48N-g/edit#gid=0">here</a>.
By following the Tool -> Script editor we can access Google Apps Script.
